<div><p><h6>BILLY is a versatile bookcase that works just as good as a storage unit and is suitable to use in many different ways at home.
The white BILLY drawer with castors matches BILLY bookcase perfectly and turns the lower part of the bookcase into a generous and closed storage space.
<em>The drawer gives you space for things like <ul>board games, cords, fitness equipment</ul> and other items you often have out but like to hide away when not in use.</em>
Mounted with drawer slides that keep the drawer in the bookcase and prevent it from being pulled out too far.
Easy to pull out and push in again since the castors roll smoothly on the floor.
The bookcase´s adjustable shelves allow you to decide the drawer´s volume and function. Place the last shelf in line with the drawer front for fully closed storage or lower to get a good grip of the drawer.</h6><p></div>
